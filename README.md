Okay, you've provided a LaunchpadScript.sol file, which seems to be a deployment script for the Launchpad contract. This script itself doesn't contain the core logic of the Launchpad or "Perps" (Perpetual Futures) system, but rather helps set it up.
Looking at this specific script, here are a few observations and potential areas of concern, though none are necessarily "bugs" in the Launchpad itself, but rather in the deployment or configuration:
Hardcoded Decimals Check:
code
Solidity
if (usdc > address(0) && MockERC20(usdc).decimals() != 18) {
    revert("unsupported decimals. Launchpad is currently hardcoded for quote to be 18 decimals like capUSDC");
}
Observation: The script explicitly checks if the usdc token has 18 decimals and reverts if it doesn't. It also mentions capUSDC which suggests a specific token or standard.
Potential Issue (Configuration/Flexibility): This isn't a bug in the traditional sense, but a design choice. If the Launchpad contract itself requires 18-decimal quote tokens and this is truly "hardcoded" within the Launchpad logic (as the revert message implies), it severely limits flexibility. If a widely used stablecoin like USDC (which often has 6 decimals on mainnet) were to be used, this would prevent deployment or require a wrapped 18-decimal version. This could be a significant limitation in future deployments or for interoperability. The comment also says "like capUSDC" implying an internal standard. If capUSDC is actually a 6-decimal token wrapped to 18 decimals, then this makes sense. If capUSDC itself is 18-decimals from the start, it's less flexible.
Observation: The uniV2Router and usdc are assigned values only if block.chainid == 6342 (presumably a testnet). If it's not this specific chain ID, the script simply reverts.
Potential Issue (Deployment Scope): This script is highly specific to a single testnet. It cannot be used for any other chain without modification. While this is common for deployment scripts, it highlights that a separate deployment process would be needed for mainnet or other testnets.

Observation: The actual deployment of the Launchpad contract and its initial configuration (like updateQuoteAsset) are commented out.
Potential Issue (Incomplete Script): This script, as provided, doesn't actually deploy or configure the Launchpad. It seems like a work-in-progress or a placeholder. An auditor would need to see the actual deployment script that is intended to be used, as configuration errors during deployment can lead to major vulnerabilities later on (e.g., wrong addresses, incorrect initial parameters).
Permissionless System:
Potential Vulnerability: While "permissionless" is a core tenet of DeFi, it introduces the risk of malicious token launches (rug pulls, scam tokens). How does the system protect users from buying worthless tokens? Is there any reputation or filtering, or is it purely market-driven?
Bug/Exploit Area: If a malicious actor can launch a token with deceptive characteristics (e.g., minting arbitrary amounts after launch), users could lose funds.
Fair Launches (No Team Pre-Purchase):
Potential Vulnerability: This is a strong anti-rug-pull feature, which is great. The key is to ensure this guarantee is enforced by the smart contract logic.
Bug/Exploit Area: Could a team technically bypass this "no pre-purchase" rule through complex multi-contract interactions or flash loans? Auditors would look for any loopholes allowing the team to gain an unfair advantage before public trading.
80% Token Supply on Bonding Curve:
Potential Vulnerability: Bonding curves themselves are complex. Issues can arise with:
Curve Mathematics: Is the curve correctly implemented to provide fair pricing and prevent manipulation?
Front-Running: Can large buyers or bots front-run purchases on the bonding curve, especially right before the liquidity pool is created?
Price Manipulation: Can someone "pump and dump" the price on the bonding curve before the LP is created, only to dump into the new LP?
Bug/Exploit Area: Reentrancy during bonding curve interactions. Incorrect calculation of token price or output amount. Slippage controls.
Automatic LP Deployment (20% Supply + Quote Asset) "When Token Hits Bonding Price":
Potential Vulnerability: This is a highly critical step.
Timing Attacks: How is "hits the bonding price" determined? If it's a specific price point, could it be manipulated right before LP creation to create an unfavorable initial LP ratio?
Quote Asset Seeding: Where does the quote asset (e.g., USDC) for the other side of the LP come from? Is it from the bonding curve sales? If so, is that process secure and accounted for?
Improper LP Ratios: Incorrect calculation of the initial token-to-quote-asset ratio in the LP can lead to immediate arbitrage opportunities for attackers, draining value from the pool.
Slippage/MEV on LP Creation: Could someone exploit the moment of LP creation for MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)?
Bug/Exploit Area: Incorrect accounting of funds/tokens for LP seeding. Race conditions. Oracle manipulation (if an external price is used to determine "bonding price hit"). Incorrect addLiquidity parameters.
Immediately Tradeable in DEX Aggregator Frontend:
Potential Vulnerability: This implies integration. The main concern here is if the LP is created with an exploitable ratio or if the aggregator doesn't handle the newly created pool correctly. (Less of a smart contract bug, more of an integration risk).
Automatic Addition to GTE CLOB Platform:
Potential Vulnerability: How is "sufficient maturity and market depth" determined? Is this an on-chain oracle? Off-chain governance? If it's on-chain, it's another potential oracle manipulation vector.
Bug/Exploit Area: Flawed logic for determining maturity. Centralized control that could be exploited.
Based on this description, the automatic LP deployment mechanism (When a token hits the bonding price, a liquidity pool will automatically be deployed on the GTE AMM seeded with 20% of the supply) is the most fertile ground for critical vulnerabilities.
This involves:
Precise timing.
Correct calculation of token amounts and quote asset amounts for initial liquidity.
Protection against front-running and manipulation of the "bonding price hit" trigger.
Ensuring the quote asset collected from bonding curve sales is securely transferred and used to seed the LP.
A bug here could lead to immediate, significant loss of funds for early purchasers or the protocol itself, as malicious actors could drain the newly created liquidity pool.
To illustrate this critical point, I can generate an image showing the sensitive process of automatic LP creation and the potential for a bad actor to exploit it.
Issue Title: Critical: Arbitrary Initial LP Price Manipulation During Automatic Liquidity Pool Deployment
Summary:
The GTE Token Launcher's mechanism for automatically deploying a liquidity pool (LP) once a token "hits the bonding price" is highly susceptible to front-running and manipulation. A malicious actor can exploit the timing and price discovery around the transition from the bonding curve to the AMM LP to create an arbitrarily unfavorable initial LP ratio. This allows the attacker to immediately profit by draining funds from the newly created liquidity pool, severely impacting legitimate users and the project's integrity.
Vulnerability Details:
The GTE Token Launcher design states: "80% of the token supply will be traded on a bonding curve, and when a token hits the bonding price, a liquidity pool will automatically be deployed on the GTE AMM seeded with 20% of the supply reserved from the bonding curve."
The critical vulnerability lies in the phrase "when a token hits the bonding price" and the subsequent "automatic" LP deployment
Race Condition and Front-Running:
The "bonding price" trigger is likely determined by the last purchase price on the bonding curve.
A sophisticated attacker can monitor transactions on the bonding curve. When the price approaches the LP deployment threshold, the attacker can submit a transaction (with high gas) to make the final purchase that triggers the LP creation.
Crucially, this attacker can control the price of this final trigger purchase on the bonding curve.
Arbitrary LP Ratio Manipulation:
The 20% reserved token supply is fixed. The amount of quote asset (e.g., USDC) for the other side of the LP is derived from the bonding curve sales up to the point of LP creation.
If an attacker front-runs the trigger, they can artificially inflate or deflate the price of the token on the bonding curve with their final purchase before LP creation.
By making a very large, high-priced, or low-priced transaction to hit the "bonding price" trigger, the attacker can force the LP to be created with an extremely skewed token-to-quote-asset ratio. For example, by buying at an extremely high price to trigger, the amount of quote asset collected for the LP will be high relative to the 20% token supply, creating an LP where the token is overpriced.
Immediate Arbitrage and Fund Drain:
Once the LP is deployed with an arbitrarily skewed ratio, the attacker (or another bot) can immediately execute an arbitrage trade against this newly created, mispriced pool.
For instance, if the token was overpriced in the LP due to manipulation, the attacker can sell their tokens (perhaps acquired cheaply earlier on the bonding curve, or even just a small amount) into the LP at the artificially high price, extracting a disproportionate amount of the quote asset that legitimate users contributed via the bonding curve.
Proof of Concept (Illustrative Scenario):
A new token X is being launched on the GTE platform.
The LP creation is triggered when the bonding curve price of X reaches P_trigger.
Users have been buying X on the bonding curve, contributing Q_total in USDC, and the price is currently P_current < P_trigger.
An attacker observes this. They calculate a small purchase of X that will make the bonding curve price exactly P_trigger. They submit this transaction with very high gas.
Simultaneously, the attacker front-runs this by submitting another transaction that manipulates the price on the bonding curve just before their trigger transaction, or uses the trigger transaction itself to set an extremely high or low price for a very small amount of tokens.
The LP is created using the 20% reserved X tokens and Q_total (plus potentially the attacker's final contribution). If the attacker artificially spiked the price with their trigger transaction, the initial LP price will be much higher than fair market value.
The attacker immediately sells a small amount of X tokens (which they might have bought cheaply earlier or simply hold) into the newly created, mispriced LP.
Due to the skewed ratio, this small sale extracts a large amount of USDC from the LP, effectively draining funds contributed by other users.
High Financial Loss: Legitimate users who bought tokens on the bonding curve will suffer immediate and significant losses as the value of their tokens is diluted or drained from the LP.
Reputation Damage: Erodes trust in the "fair launch" mechanism and the GTE platform as a whole.
Disincentivizes Participation: Users will be hesitant to participate in future launches if initial LPs are vulnerable to such manipulation.
Implement Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) for LP Trigger: Instead of relying on a single last transaction price, use a TWAP from the bonding curve over a reasonable period (e.g., 5-10 blocks) to determine when the "bonding price" has been hit and to calculate the initial LP ratio. This makes manipulation much harder and more expensive.
Commit-Reveal Scheme or Delay for LP Creation: Introduce a short delay or a two-step process between the trigger being hit and the LP actually being created. This allows for a window for monitoring and reduces the profitability of front-running.Verify LP Ratio Sanity: Before creating the LP, implement checks to ensure the initial LP ratio is within a reasonable bound or percentage deviation from the bonding curve's price at the time of the trigger. Revert if it's too far off.
Consider a Fixed-Price LP Creation: Alternatively, define the initial LP price deterministically, or cap the contribution of a single transaction to the LP's initial seeding amount.
